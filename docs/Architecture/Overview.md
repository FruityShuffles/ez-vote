# Architecture Overview

> **A Flutter → React migration is in progress** ([[Migration/Overview]]). The Flutter app described below is the frozen parity reference and remains deployed until cutover. The React app being built to parity lives in `web-react/` (see "React App" below). This document describes the Flutter architecture; it will be reframed around React at decommission (M22).

## React App (`web-react/`)

Scaffolded in M5 per the [[Migration/Tech Stack]] decisions. A client-rendered SPA that deploys as static assets to Cloudflare Pages exactly like the Flutter build (own `_redirects` SPA fallback + `_headers`), against the **same** Supabase backend.

| Concern | Flutter | React (`web-react/`) |
|---|---|---|
| Build / rendering | Flutter web (CanvasKit) | Vite + React Router SPA |
| Server state | Riverpod `FutureProvider`s (see Provider Taxonomy) | TanStack Query (one key per provider) |
| Client state | Riverpod notifiers | Zustand (minimal — chiefly the ballot draft) |
| Styling | Flutter theme | Tailwind CSS |
| Components / a11y | Material widgets | shadcn + Base UI primitives (owned source) |
| Env / credentials | `--dart-define` → `SUPABASE_*` | Vite build-time `import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_*` |

Layout: routing in `src/router.tsx`; routes in `src/routes/`; Supabase client in `src/lib/supabase.ts`; Zustand stores in `src/stores/`; owned shadcn components in `src/components/ui/`. CI (`.github/workflows/web-react-ci.yml`) runs lint + type-check + Vitest + build on `web-react/**` changes. Staging deploys to the `ez-vote-react` Cloudflare Pages project. Auth/session wiring is M6; the implemented surface ports include results, election detail, ballots, and election creation/editing (M8-M11).

## Three-Layer Clean Architecture

```
Data Layer        → lib/data/repositories/
Domain Layer      → lib/domain/models/, lib/domain/services/
Presentation      → lib/presentation/screens/, /providers/, /widgets/
```

Data never flows upward. Screens never call repositories directly — they go through Riverpod providers.

## Data Flow

```
Supabase SDK
  → Repository (lib/data/repositories/)
    → Riverpod Provider (lib/presentation/providers/providers.dart)
      → Screen (.when(loading, error, data))
```

After a mutation, call `ref.invalidate(provider)` to trigger a refetch. There is no manual state sync — invalidation drives everything.

## Provider Taxonomy

All providers live in `providers.dart`.

**Infrastructure:**
- `supabaseClientProvider` — SupabaseClient singleton
- `authStateProvider` — `Stream<AuthState>`; the root of all auth-dependent state
- `currentUserProvider` — `User?` extracted from auth stream

**Repository providers** — one per repository, created via `Provider`

**Data providers** — `FutureProvider` or `FutureProvider.family` (parameterized by election ID):

| Provider | Type | What it fetches |
|---|---|---|
| `ownedElectionsProvider` | FutureProvider | Elections owned by current user |
| `votedElectionsProvider` | FutureProvider | Elections where user cast a ballot |
| `pendingInvitationsProvider` | FutureProvider | Open elections with unaccepted invites |
| `electionProvider(id)` | FutureProvider.family | Single election by ID |
| `candidatesProvider(id)` | FutureProvider.family | Candidates for an election |
| `invitesProvider(id)` | FutureProvider.family | Invites sent for an election |
| `existingBallotProvider(id)` | FutureProvider.family | User's existing ballot (null if none) |
| `resultsProvider(id)` | FutureProvider.family | Computed results per algorithm |
| `ballotCountProvider(id)` | FutureProvider.family | Number of ballots cast |
| `electionVotersProvider(id)` | FutureProvider.family | Voter display names |
| `pendingInviteesProvider(id)` | FutureProvider.family | Users with pending invites |
| `priorCovotersProvider(id)` | FutureProvider.family | Users who voted with current user elsewhere |

All data providers watch `authStateProvider` and invalidate on user change.

## Routing

GoRouter in `lib/config/router.dart`. `usePathUrlStrategy()` in `main.dart` enables clean paths (no `#`).

**Named routes:**

| Path | Screen | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | LandingScreen | Public |
| `/login` | LoginScreen | Public |
| `/signup` | SignupScreen | Public |
| `/dashboard` | HomeScreen | Auth required |
| `/create` | CreateElectionScreen | Auth required |
| `/election/:id` | ElectionDetailScreen | Auth + participant |
| `/election/:id/edit` | CreateElectionScreen (edit mode) | Owner only |
| `/election/:id/vote` | BallotScreen | Auth + participant |
| `/election/:id/join` | JoinElectionScreen | Auth required |
| `/election/:id/invite` | InviteVotersScreen | Owner only |
| `/settings` | SettingsScreen | Auth required |
| `/privacy`, `/tos`, `/learn` | Info screens | Public |

**Auth redirect:** Unauthenticated users go to `/login?redirect=<encoded-path>`. On successful login, the `redirect` param is decoded and used for `context.go()`. The param threads through the entire signup flow too — login → signup → OTP verification all preserve it.

**Navigation conventions:**
- `context.push()` — forward navigation (preserves back stack)
- `context.go()` — post-auth transitions (replaces history)

No `refreshListenable` on the router. Auth transitions are handled by explicit `context.go()` calls inside auth callbacks.

## Environment / Credentials

`lib/config/supabase_config.dart` resolves credentials in priority order:
1. `String.fromEnvironment('SUPABASE_URL')` — baked in at build time via `--dart-define`
2. `.env` file loaded via `flutter_dotenv` — local dev fallback

`main.dart` wraps Supabase init in try/catch and shows a red error screen if credentials are missing, so misconfiguration is immediately visible.

**Email:** Resend is configured as custom SMTP in Supabase (Authentication → Settings → SMTP) to bypass free-tier email rate limits. There is no Resend SDK in the codebase — Supabase sends OTP/auth emails through Resend transparently.

## Screen Inventory

| LoginScreen | Email/password signin + Google OAuth |
| SignupScreen | Email/password/display name + OTP verification |
| HomeScreen | 3-tab dashboard: My Elections, My Votes, Learn |
| CreateElectionScreen | Create or edit election (algorithms, candidates, feature flags) |
| ElectionDetailScreen | View election, results, candidate list, owner controls |
| BallotScreen | Vote interface — 7 templates |
| InviteVotersScreen | Email invite management |
| JoinElectionScreen | Quick join redirect screen |
| SettingsScreen | Account settings, delete account |
| ResultsView (widget) | Algorithm-by-algorithm results cards |
| LearnScreen | Voting method educational content |
